# Privacy Background (Spark AR project)

Privacy Background filter allows you to hide your background partially or completely by choosing from 5 different styles: pixelation, blur, noise, darkening, and brightening. You can adjust the level visibility of the background with slider and tap to instantly reveal or hide it. It can be used simply for utilitarian use: to hide a mess behind you, but it can also be used as a storytelling tool. Epic reveals, stylish transitions, an additional mystery in the story â€” those are just some examples.
